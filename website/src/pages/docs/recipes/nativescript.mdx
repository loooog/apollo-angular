# Integrating with NativeScript

You can use Apollo with NativeScript exactly as you would with normal Angular application.

To introduce Apollo to your app, install `apollo-angular` from npm and use them in your app as outlined in the [setup](../get-started.md) article:

<PackageCmd packages={['apollo-angular --save']} />

<Callout type="info">
**Note** There are more packages to be installed, so check out the "initialization" article.
</Callout>

```typescript
import { NativeScriptModule } from 'nativescript-angular/nativescript.module';
import { NativeScriptHttpClientModule } from 'nativescript-angular/http-client';
import { ApolloModule, Apollo } from 'apollo-angular';
import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-angular/http';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NativeScriptModule,
    NativeScriptHttpClientModule, // this provides HttpClient
    ApolloModule,
  ]
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(
    apollo: Apollo,
    httpLink: HttpLink
  ) {
    // create Apollo
    apollo.create({
      link: httpLink.create({ uri }),
      // other options like cache
    });
  }
}
```

If you are new to using Apollo with Angular, you should probably read the [Angular guide](/).

## Examples

There are some Apollo examples written in NativeScript that you may wish to refer to:
