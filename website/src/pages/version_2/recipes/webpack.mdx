# Webpack Loader
You can load GraphQL queries over `.graphql` files using Webpack. The package [`@graphql-tools/webpack-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-tools/webpack-loader) comes with a loader easy to setup and with some benefits:

1. Do not process GraphQL ASTs on client-side
1. Enable queries to be separated from logic

In the example below, we create a new file called `currentUser.graphql`:

```graphql
query CurrentUserForLayout {
  currentUser {
    login
    avatar_url
  }
}
```

You can load this file adding a rule in your webpack config file:

```typescript
rules: [
  {
    test: /\.(graphql|gql)$/,
    exclude: /node_modules/,
    loader: '@graphql-tools/webpack-loader'
  }
]
```

As you can see, `.graphql` or `.gql` files will be parsed whenever imported:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Apollo } from 'apollo-angular';

import currentUserQuery from './currentUser.graphql';

@Component({ ... })
class ProfileComponent {
  constructor(
    apollo: Apollo
  ) {
    apollo.query({ query: currentUserQuery })
      .subscribe(result => { ... });
  }
}
```


### Optional: Install and configure a custom Webpack configuration (when using Angular CLI)

Install `@angular-builders/custom-webpack` with the following command:

<PackageCmd packages={['@angular-builders/custom-webpack']} />

(Or alternative command when using yarn or another package-manager)

Then create a Webpack-configuration file `webpack.config.js` in your application root containing your Webpack configuration (as listed above):

```
module.exports = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.(graphql|gql)$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                loader: '@graphql-tools/webpack-loader'
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

After that, create your type-definition for your `.graphql` files, so TypeScript will transform them into importable objects with `src/@types/graphql.d.ts`:

```
declare module '*.graphql' {
    import { DocumentNode } from 'graphql'
    const schema: DocumentNode

    export = schema
}
```

Next, update your TSConfig (`tsconfig.json`):

```
{
  ...
  "files": [
    ...
    "src/@types/graphql.d.ts"
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "typeRoots": [
      ...
      "src/@types"
    ]
  }
}
```

Finally you have to manipulate your `angular.json` to accept your customized Webpack configuration:

```
{
  ...
  "projects": {
    "<Your project name here>": {
      ...
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          ...
          "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser",
          "options": {
            "customWebpackConfig": {
              "path": "./webpack.config.js",
              "replaceDuplicatePlugins": true
            },
          }
        }
        "serve": {
          ...
          "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:dev-server",
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Jest

[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) can't use the Webpack loaders. To make the same transformation work in Jest, use [`@graphql-tools/jest-transform`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-tools/jest-transform).

## Fragments

You can use and include fragments in `.graphql` files and have webpack include those dependencies for you, similar to how you would use fragments and queries with the gql tag in plain JS.

```graphql
#import "./UserInfoFragment.graphql"

query CurrentUserForLayout {
  currentUser {
    ...UserInfo
  }
}
```

See how we import the UserInfo fragment from another `.graphql` file (same way you'd import modules in JS).

And here's an example of defining the fragment in another `.graphql` file.

```graphql
fragment UserInfo on User {
  login
  avatar_url
}
```
