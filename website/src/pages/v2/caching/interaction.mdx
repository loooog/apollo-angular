# Reading and Writing Data to the Cache

Apollo Client provides three methods for reading and writing data to the cache:

- `readQuery` and `readFragment`
- `writeQuery` and `writeFragment`
- `cache.modify` (a method of `InMemoryCache`)

Please read the ["Reading and writing data to the cache"](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-interaction/) chapter on Apollo Client documentation.
