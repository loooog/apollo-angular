# Customizing the Behavior of Cached Fields

You can customize how a particular field in your Apollo Client cache is read and written. To do so, you define a **field policy** for the field. A field policy can include:

- A `read` function that specifies what happens when the field's cached value is read
- A `merge` function that specifies what happens when field's cached value is written
- An array of key arguments that help the cache avoid storing unnecessary duplicate data.

Please read the ["Customizing the behavior of cached fields"](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/) chapter on Apollo Client documentation.
