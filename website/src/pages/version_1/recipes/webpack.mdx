# Webpack Loader

You can load GraphQL queries over `.graphql` files using Webpack. The package `graphql-tag` comes with a loader easy to setup and with some benefits:

1. Do not process GraphQL ASTs on client-side
1. Enable queries to be separated from logic

In the example below, we create a new file called `currentUser.graphql`:

```graphql filename="currentUser.graphql"
query CurrentUserForLayout {
  currentUser {
    login
    avatar_url
  }
}
```

You can load this file adding a rule in your webpack config file:

```js
loaders: [
  {
    test: /\.(graphql|gql)$/,
    exclude: /node_modules/,
    loader: 'graphql-tag/loader'
  }
]
```

As you can see, `.graphql` or `.gql` files will be parsed whenever imported:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Apollo } from 'apollo-angular';

import currentUserQuery from './currentUser.graphql';

@Component({ ... })
class ProfileComponent {
  constructor(
    apollo: Apollo
  ) {
    apollo.query({ query: currentUserQuery })
      .subscribe(result => { ... });
  }
}
```

## Jest

[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) can't use the Webpack loaders. To make the same transformation work in Jest, use [jest-transform-graphql](https://github.com/remind101/jest-transform-graphql).

## Fragments

You can use and include fragments in `.graphql` files and have webpack include those dependencies for you, similar to how you would use fragments and queries with the gql tag in plain JS.

```graphql
#import "./UserInfoFragment.graphql"

query CurrentUserForLayout {
  currentUser {
    ...UserInfo
  }
}
```

See how we import the UserInfo fragment from another `.graphql` file (same way you'd import modules in JS).

And here's an example of defining the fragment in another `.graphql` file.

```graphql
fragment UserInfo on User {
  login
  avatar_url
}
```
