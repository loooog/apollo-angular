# Multiple Clients

With `apollo-angular` it is possible to use multiple Apollo Clients in your application.

## Creating Clients

You are already familiar with how to create a single client so it should be easy to understand it.

There are few ways of creating named clients.

One way is to use `Apollo.create`. Normally, you would use it like this:

```ts
apollo.create(options)
```

This will define a default client but there is one optional argument.

```ts
apollo.create(options, name?)
```

An example:

```ts
apollo.create(defaultOptions)
apollo.create(extraOptions, 'extra')
```

Now you have the default client and one called `extra`.

<Callout type="info">
Important thing to know is if you want to define a default client, simply do not use any `name` argument or set it to `default`.
</Callout>

The other way is to use helper methods.

```ts
apollo.createDefault(options)
// and
apollo.createNamed(name, options);
```

## Using Apollo

Since we have our clients available in an app, now is the time to see how to use them.

If a client is defined as the default, you can directly use all methods of the `Apollo` service.

About named clients, simply use the method called `use(name: string)`.

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Apollo, QueryRef } from 'apollo-angular';

@Component({...})
export class AppComponent {
  feedQuery: QueryRef<any>;

  constructor(apollo: Apollo) {
    // use default
    this.feedQuery = apollo.watchQuery({...});

    // use extra client
    this.feedQuery = apollo.use('extra').watchQuery({...});
  }
}
```
